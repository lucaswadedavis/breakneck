# simple 4 step calculation
# step 1: how much energy (and as a consequence, how big a rocket) would be needed to push Phobos into Mars

# step 2: how much ejecta would be produced by a hit from the asteroid

# step 3: how much would that ejecta falling back to the Martian surface heat the atmosphere

# step 4: how much (and for how long) would the atmosphere need to be heated in order to sublimate a sufficient amount of the frozen CO2 and H2O in order to create a self-sustaining, thick, warm Martian atmosphere.
