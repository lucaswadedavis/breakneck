#Breakneck

is my notebook for a new idea on the topic of Martian terraforming: kickstart the Martian greenhouse by superheating the atmosphere with ejecta from the impact of a large asteriod (Phobos and Deimos are handily nearby). The hot atmosphere would sublimate some amount of the frozen CO2 and H2O on the surface, and - if all goes well - create a self-sustaining greenhouse effect that would last for a convienient amount of time.
